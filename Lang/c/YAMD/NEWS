v0.32

	* Various minor compilation and documentation fixes.

Aug 12 1999

v0.31
	* Have Linux use mmap for allocations.  This is more memory
	efficient and apparently faster (perhaps because of not
	needing to swap).
	* Add YAMD_LOGFILE as an alias for YAMD_LOGFILE_NAME; it's
	nicer to type.
	* Sensible Makefile defaults are now used on both platforms
	without needing to edit.
	* Minor bug fixes and documentation updates.

Jun 5 1999

v0.30
	* Fix problems with libc activities causing lossage.
	* YAMD_ENABLE is now gone; YAMD is effectively always
	enabled.  It couldn't be avoided.

Apr 7 1999

v0.23
	* Fix constructor troubles (I hope).
	* Fix bug: logging NULL block when memory low.
	* Change logfile format a bit, to let it work with gsymify.
	* run-yamd now works under DJGPP.

Apr 5 1999

v0.22
	* Fix silly traceback bug.

Apr 5 1999

v0.21
	* Fix misuse of $(DJGPP) in Makefile.
	* Document constructor bug.
	* Clean up some more.

Apr 3 1999

v0.2
	* Change the block lookup algorithm to use a hash table.
	* Avoid trying to check magic on blocks that don't need it.
	These two fixes yield a large speedup.
	* Fix a few bugs, including misbehavior of memalign when
	aligning to boundaries > 4096.
	* Clean up the code a bit.

Mar 29 1999
